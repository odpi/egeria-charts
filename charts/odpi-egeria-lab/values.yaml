  # K8s implementations vary. Setting the max ram by percentage is better, but is very platform dependent - depending on the container
  # environment being used - for example cgroups vs cgroups2. Therefore the default sets explicit values, so set in both places
  # and make the max heap approx 80% of the memory limit

# 'pullPolicy' with the value to use for the override (if you want to use the public Docker registry, use
# 'docker.io/library' as the registry override, and set namespace to be your user or organization id).
# Note that now 'pullPolicy' is automatically set to 'Always' for snapshots, and 'IfNotPresent' for stable releases

# Persistence
# 
# If you enable persistence 
#  - Any metadata servers configured by the notebooks will be configured to use the graph repository
#  - A persistent volume (pvc) will be used to store all cohort registry, server config, and graph data
#  - the name of the volume is based on the helm 'release' so same release will mean the data will remain on redeployment
#    or starting
#  - Note that the 'config' notebook will actually start servers if config is found, and you may get unexpected results
#  - This config is provided to help with those using the lab environment as a base for further work
#  - You may also wish to look at the 'egeria-base' helm chart for a single persistent server
#  - You should also set all the kafka persistence settings below to 'true'
#  - You should also set the value of egeria.repositoryType above in 'in-memory-repository'

# installed on the cluster by an admin, or a prior install
